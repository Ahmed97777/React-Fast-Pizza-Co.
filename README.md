#### Note: This project was created as part of my journey to deepen my understanding of React. While I already had a foundation in React, Jonas Schmedtmann's online course on Udemy (The Ultimate React Course 2023: React, Redux & More) played a pivotal role in expanding my knowledge and enhancing my skills.
